## Testing Philosophy

> “The more your tests resemble the way the software is used, the more confidence they can give you.” — Kent C. Dodds

I focus on building automation strategies that provide real confidence rather than chasing superficial metrics.
My approach emphasizes:

- Selecting the right testing level (unit, integration, E2E, performance, accessibility, visual regression)
- Prioritizing business-critical flows over blanket coverage targets
- Designing automation that scales with the product lifecycle
- Using testing as a decision-support tool, not just a reporting metric

The goal is sustainable quality: fast feedback loops, meaningful safety nets, and automation aligned with actual product risks.
